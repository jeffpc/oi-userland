This component is based on Oracle userland one, but most of the patches comes from Joyent
https://github.com/joyent/illumos-extra/tree/master/openssh/Patches
(including patches from userland-gate, which were updated by Alex Wilson to work with 7.1p1)
We don't need the following patches due to difference in OpenSSH and OpenSSL packaging

The following patches were modified to apply without patches which we don't use
	0030-Set-default-sshd-options-based-on-etc-default-login.patch
