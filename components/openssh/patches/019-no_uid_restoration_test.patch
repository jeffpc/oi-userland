#
# OpenSSH verifies, that changing [ug]id back to 0 fails, after it
# was set to the values of the user logging in.
# On Solaris, if that user was given PRIV_PROC_SETUID privilege,
# set[gu]id(0) succeeds. But in this case this is not an error in
# dropping privilege, such user is supposed to be able to do that.
#
# This fix removes this check entirely. Skipping the check only in
# case PRIV_PROC_SETUID is asserted in the effective set was considered
# but decided against. The check is redundant, because inability to
# restore uid=0 can be inferred from successful run of setreuid(uid, uid).
#
# The fix is implemented by replacing an OS-related HAVE_CYGWIN guard
# with a functional NO_UID_RESTORATION_TEST and by defining the new
# symbol in the component Makefile.
#
# This patch was submitted upstream:
#
# https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2299
#
# See the above URL for details on if/when it might be accepted.
