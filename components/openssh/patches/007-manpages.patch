# This change is Solaris-specific and thus is not being contributed back
# to the upstream community.  Details:
#
# OpenSSH uses the BSD/Linux man page scheme which is different from the SysV
# man page scheme used in Solaris.  In order to comply to the Solaris man page
# policy and also use the IPS mediator to switch between SunSSH and OpenSSH man
# pages, the section numbers of some OpenSSH man pages are changed to be the
# same as their corresponding ones in SunSSH.
